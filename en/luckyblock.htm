<h3>Three ways to get Lucky Blocks:</h3>
<p>1. By crafting. </p>

<p>
2. Good Lucky Blocks(Luck = +75) have a higher probability of being generated in the desert.
  Bad Lucky Blocks(Luck = -75) are likely to spawn in plains, deserts, etc.
  Regular Lucky Blocks(Luck = 0) are generated in large numbers on the outer islands of the End dimension,
  but also, with a small probability, in Overworld dimension or Nether dimension.</p>  


<p>
3. By using commands. Use<br>
<code>/function luckygive</code><br>
to get some Lucky Blocks, a Lucky Sword, a Lucky Bow and some Lucky Potions.<br>
Or simply use /give command, like <code>/give @p weizhi:lucky_block</code>
